Hello I am Eli a Web Developer and Musician. I am Dedicated to every journey I embark. 
I give 100% or nothing at all! When I started as a Web Developer a few years ago, learning different languages  ( JavaScript , Python ,HTML, CSS, and more! 
I fell in love with creating and the process in between. The Success and the Failures as well I understand that this will develop a great product. My musical background as well
seem to complement my development skills equally.  In many ways by creating a sound mind to create great products but also solve great problems in the process.
When it comes to the journey it has created great character development and qualities that can't be be taught but is built in on a deeper level like certain processes in development.
What have i learned from it all,
Patience, Resilience, Laser-Focused, Daily Self-Improvement, few other traits that equal to a great scheme to succeed 

All challenges are meant to be overcame. like an old relationship. I got past it no problem.
