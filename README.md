Hello, I am Danielle I prefer to be called "ELi" I am a Web Developer and Musician, I am Dedicated to every journey I embark on. 
I give 100% or nothing at all! When I started as a Web Developer a few years ago, learning different languages ( JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, React.js, and more! 
I fell in love with creating and the process in between. I also understand that Success and Failures are needed to create an amazing product.
My extensive musical background has seemed to complement my development skills equally. 
In many ways by creating a sound mind to create great products but also solve significant problems in the process. When it comes to the journey it has initiated great character development and qualities that can't be taught but are built-in on a deeper level like certain processes in development. 
What have I learned from it all, Patience, Resilience, Laser-Focused, Daily Self-Improvement, and a few other traits equal a great program to succeed in Real Life.

All challenges are meant to be overcome, like an old Challenge I got past it with no problem.
